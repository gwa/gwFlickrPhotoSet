FlickrPhotoSet
==============

PHP class for reading flickr photosets.

## Tests

To run the tests you will need to create the `tests/config.php` file, adding your Flickr API key and a photoset ID.

To ensure a consistent code base, you should make sure the code follows the PSR-2 Coding Standards.

The easiest way to do make sure you're following the coding standard is to run vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix before committing.
